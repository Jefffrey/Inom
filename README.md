##Inom

This library is aimed at being a proof of concept and nothing more. It's not intended for any real use and it's numerically just a mental and theoretical masturbation.

####Examples

```c++
int main() {
    auto x = inom::make_int<1>();
    auto y = inom::make_int<2>();
    std::cout << (x + y); // 2
}
```
